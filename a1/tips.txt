1. First, to consider dead boxes case, if anybody is unable to move or no storage it can reach, (i.e. a box at a corner or side box has no side storage for it)we should return infinite immediately.

2. Since we have time bound, so do not make too many loops. Try to let each loop handle more jobs, and reduce the total iteration.
